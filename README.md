# ELEC-380-Intro-To-NeuroEngineering

This course covers advanced stati sti cal signal processing and machine learning approachesfor modern neuroscience data (primarily many-channel spike trains). Topics include latentvariable models, point processes, Bayesian inference, dimensionality reducti on, dynamicalsystems, and spectral analysis. Neuroscience applicati ons include modeling neural fi ring rates,spike sorti ng, decoding, characterizati on of neural systems, and fi eld potenti al analysis.

## Prerequisites:
E&M Phyics or basic circuits
Programming COMP140 or equivalent (i.e., CAAM210),
Python will be used for many of the homework assignments so some familiarity withscienti fi c programming is criti cal.

## Required Materials:
You will need a computer capable of running Python or Matlab. A laptop is preferred in orderto allow you to parti cipate in coding exercises during class.

## Textbook:
No textbook is required, but some useful references include: 
1) Theoreti cal Neuroscience by Dayan and Abbot.
2) Principles of Neural Science by Kandel, Koester, Mack, and Siegelbaum.


## Objecti ve:
Students should learn the fundamentals of how the acti vity of neurons representsinformati on within in the brain, how this acti vity can be monitored experimentally, and howto decode underlying informati on from the resulti ng neural data. In additi on, students shouldlearn modern techniques for controlled perturbati on of neural circuits.
## Outcome:
Students completi ng the course should be able to:
Students are comfortable with neural data in many diff erent forms, including “spikes”measured intracellularly, extracellularly, opti cally, and LFP/EEG.
Students are comfortable building generati ve models that describe neural acti vity eitherfrom fi rst principles or using experimental data.
Students are comfortable using generati ve models to opti mally decode underlyinginformati on from neural acti vity.
